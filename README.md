Project: Fast-Track

Fast-Track is an innovative mapping application designed to enhance route planning and optimization. Users can interact with the map by adding a series of points through address searches or direct clicks on the map interface. The application then displays a route connecting these points. Additionally, users can optimize the route to find the most efficient path between the selected points.

Key Features:
Interactive Map Interface:

Integrates with OpenStreetMap, providing detailed and accurate map data.
Users can add markers by clicking on the map or by entering addresses, making the interface user-friendly and versatile.
Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding:

The application supports geocoding, converting addresses into geographical coordinates.
Reverse geocoding is also implemented, allowing users to get address information from latitude and longitude coordinates.
Route Display and Optimization:

Once points are set, the application displays a route connecting all the markers on the map.
Users can optimize the route, ensuring the most efficient path is calculated and displayed.
User-Friendly Marker Management:

Markers can be easily added, viewed, and removed.
The application ensures that users have the flexibility to manage their points and adjust routes as needed.
Real-Time Route Calculation:

The application dynamically calculates and updates the route as markers are added or removed.
Users can see the immediate impact of changes, enhancing the planning experience.
This project aims to provide a seamless and efficient route planning tool, integrating powerful mapping features with user-friendly interactions.
